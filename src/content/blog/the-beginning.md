# The Beginning

This is wanna be just an introduction to what you can expect from this personal blog and its contents.

The vision is inspired by Harry Cresswell's job and his way of presenting and explaining things. There will be a mix of technical articles with more personal and intrusive ones, like this one.

It's been a while since I wanted to start sharing my knowledge, thoughts, and reflections about programming and the tech world in general, but that's not usual for me, and writing long technical blog posts is not either.

Probably, I have never found the right medium to do it, because I'm not really into social media like X and LinkedIn, but maybe a very personal space, such as my website, could be the right place to start.

And so here I am to share the reasons that pushed me to write the following articles.

Hopefully, you will find something useful in the words I will put on this blog.

Let's start with the first article.
